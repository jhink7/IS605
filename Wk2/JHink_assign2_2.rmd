Problem Set 1

1) Proove A^T^A != AA^T^

Sinc in general A^T^ is not guaranteed to be equal to A, let B = A^T^

Rewrite:

BA != AB

This agrees with a fundamental property of matrices.  IE - their multiplication is not generally commutative. The proof of this theorem is widely available.

The following is a quick proof via counterexample.  We aim to falsify that A^T^A = AA^T^

```{r}
A <- matrix(seq(from=1,to=6), nrow=2, byrow=T)
r1 = A%???%t(A)
r2 = t(A)%*%A
r1
r2
```

Therefore r2 != r1


2) A special case in which A^T^A = AA^T^ is when A is symmetrical.  In other words A^T^ = A
