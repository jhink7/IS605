##Problem Set 1

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Part 1
A <- c(0,0.5,0.5,0,0,0, 0,0,1,0,0,0, 0.25,0.25,0,0,0.25,0.25, 0,0,0,0,0.5,0.5, 0,0,0,0.5,0,0.5, 0,0,0.5,0.5,0,0)


dim(A) <- c(6, 6)

B = 0.85 * A + 0.15/6

# Part 2
r = data.matrix(c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6))

k = 100
for(i in 1:k)
{
  r = B %*% r
}

# Part 3

# calculate eigen values
eigenValB = eigen(B)$values

# note the max of 1 here
eigenValB 

# calculate eigen vectors
eigVecB = eigen(B)$vectors[,1]

# scale the corresponding eigen vector by scalar value.  Also truncate the 0
# magnitude complex components
eigVecB = Re(eigVecB / -2.307201787)

# sum 
sum(eigVecB)

# check equivalence to r
check <- all.equal(data.matrix(eigVecB), r, 0.00001)
