##Problem Set 1

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#setwd("C:/CUNY/IS605/Wk11")

#### Part 1 ####

age = c(18, 23, 25, 35, 65, 54, 34, 56, 72, 19, 23, 42, 18, 39, 37)
maxHR = c(202, 186, 187, 180, 156, 169, 174, 172, 153, 199, 193, 174, 198, 183, 178)

reg1 <- lm(maxHR~age)
reg1
# The resulting equation is maxHR = -0.7977*age + 210.0485

summary(reg1)

# The effect of age on maxHR is significant.  As seen in the above summary, it is significant to the 
# "0" level.  '***' in the lm significance code schema.

# plot
par(cex=.8)
plot(age,maxHR)
abline(reg1)

#### Part 2 ####

# read data in
rawdata = read.table("auto-mpg.data")
colnames(rawdata) <- c("disp", "hp", "weight", "acc", "mpg")

# get 40 random rows
subsample = rawdata[sample(nrow(rawdata), 40), ]

reg2 = lm(subsample$mpg~subsample$disp + subsample$hp + subsample$weight + subsample$acc)
reg2

summary(reg2)

# the standard errors can be viewed in the above summary.  
# Here, only the weight of the car seems to have a significant effect on mpg.  That is at the 0.01 (*) significance level
# Note that these (and the resulting fit equation variables) will change based on the the sample chosen.  Since a new subsample
# is chosen each time the code is run, the numbers you get will vary from those in the comments for this section.
#
# the resulting equation is:
# mpg = 0.009605 * disp - 0.028684 * hp - 0.006576 * weight + 0.417358 * acc  + 36.885116
#
# Confidence Intervals:
confint(reg2, level=0.95)

reg3 = lm(rawdata$mpg~rawdata$disp + rawdata$hp + rawdata$weight + rawdata$acc)
reg3

summary(reg3)

# the standard errors can be viewed in the above summary.  
# Here, the weight of the car AND the horsepower have a significant effect on mpg.  
# Weight is significant at the 0 (***) level while hp is at the 0.001 (**) level.
#
# the resulting equation is:
# mpg = -0.0060009 * disp -0.0436077 * hp -0.0052805 * weight -0.0231480 * acc  + 45.2511397
#
# Confidence Intervals:
confint(reg3, level=0.95)

```

Regarding the latter section, the standard errors on the fitted coefficients decreased as we increased the number of datapoints in our sample.  It follows from this that our 95% confidence intervals for each of the coefficients tighten.  Also, the strength of the significance of hp and weight increased as well.  It appears we increase our signal to noise ratio as we increased our sample from 40 to the full data set (392 points).
